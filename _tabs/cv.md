# Alex Mitchell - Software Engineer

I'm a full-stack developer with 8 years of professional experience, primarily in Amazon Web Services, TypeScript, Node.js, and React, although I've worked with many more technologies than that. First a hobby, I've been programming since 2007. Feeling the direct impact my work has on end-users of a product is my primary driver. I am a self manager, and I enjoy being user-facing and driving product direction. Ask me about my dogs!
